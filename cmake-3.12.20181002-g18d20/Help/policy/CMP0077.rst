CMP0077
-------

:command:`option` honors normal variables.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to clear any existing normal variables
with the same name.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to not create
a cache entry or modify any existing normal variables if a normal variable
with the same name already exists.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.13.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.
